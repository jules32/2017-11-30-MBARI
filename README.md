In the workshop we'll use the sticky notes to indicate whether everything is OK (blue) or not (pink).

**If you've successfully installed everything listed in the [setup instructions](http://jules32.github.io/2017-11-30-MBARI/#setup), please put a blue sticky note up on your laptop.** And put up yellow if you need help. Today we'll just be using R and RStudio, so if you need help with the others we can have a look during a break.
